## 📁 Source Materials Staging Area

**Location**: `source-materials/` (at repository root, git-ignored)

**Purpose**: **Staging folder for migration** - Temporary staging area where source content is placed before review and transformation into AI-102 study materials.

**Critical Workflow**:

1. **Place materials**: User places source materials (transcripts, notes, documents) in `source-materials/` folder (at repository root)
2. **Review and migrate**: AI assistant reviews ALL files, identifies unique content, and migrates/transforms following Educational Content Rules
3. **Verify migration**: Confirm all unique content has been migrated to `docs/sessions/` or `src/`
4. **Create verification report**: Generate migration verification report in `docs/review-reports/` with date-based naming (format: `DDMonYYYY.md`, e.g., `24Nov2025.md`)
5. **Keep source files**: After successful migration, keep source files in `source-materials/` folder - user will delete manually

**Important**:

- Files in `source-materials/` are **NOT required to be compliant** - they are raw source materials
- The `source-materials/` folder itself is **permanent** - it's a staging area for ongoing migrations
- After migration, **keep source files** in `source-materials/` folder - user will delete manually

### Study Content Organization

**Important**: Content is organized by AI-102 exam domains.

**Policy**:

- ✅ Organize content by AI-102 exam domains
- ✅ Use `docs/sessions/` for study notes and documentation
- ✅ Use `src/` for code samples and hands-on labs
- ✅ Keep examples small and focused on single concepts
- ✅ Add content progressively as you study each domain

**AI-102 Exam Domains**:
- Plan and manage an Azure AI solution
- Implement generative AI solutions
- Implement an agentic solution
- Implement computer vision solutions
- Implement natural language processing solutions
- Implement knowledge mining and information extraction solutions

## 📞 Support & Escalation
