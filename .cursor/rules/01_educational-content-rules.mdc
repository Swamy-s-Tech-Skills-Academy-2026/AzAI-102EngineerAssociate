# Educational Content Rules (AI-102 Study Materials)

**Version**: 1.1  
**Last Updated**: December 11, 2025  
**Priority**: MANDATORY - All content creation must follow these rules without exception

---

## 🚫 Zero-Copy Policy (Non-Negotiable)

**CRITICAL**: All educational content must be transformative, not reformative.

❌ **NEVER** copy text verbatim from books, articles, websites, videos, or third-party materials  
❌ **NEVER** mirror a source's outline, section order, headings, or example sequence  
❌ **NEVER** use "light paraphrasing" — must transform completely  
✅ **ALWAYS** create diagrams in Mermaid-first style with ASCII fallback (never embed copyrighted figures)  
✅ **ALWAYS** write fresh, minimal code from first principles  
✅ Brief quotations allowed ONLY with quotation marks and source citation

---

## 🔄 Transformative Workflow (Required Every Time)

**Step-by-step process for creating original educational content**:

1. **Source Intake**: Skim for intent and big ideas; don't copy notes verbatim
2. **Concept Map**: Create fresh outline organized by AI-102 exam domains
3. **Teach Differently**: Use new analogies, scenarios, datasets, use-cases (avoid source examples)
4. **Produce Original Artifacts**: Explanations, Mermaid diagrams (with ASCII fallback), minimal examples
5. **Cross-Link Content**: Add references to related AI-102 exam domains and Azure services
6. **Similarity Audit**: Ensure no sentences/structures resemble source
7. **Optional References**: Add "References/Inspired by" links (no copied phrasing)

**Goal**: Create transformative educational content, not just reformative. Entirely new presentation, examples, and explanations that teach the same concepts through original methods.

---

## ⏱️ 25-Minute Learning Segments

✅ **Modular content** designed for focused 25-minute sessions  
✅ **Multi-Part Structure**: Complex topics split into Part 1, Part 2, ... Part N  
✅ **One-Shot Learning**: Each segment complete and actionable within time limit  
✅ **Target Length**: 150 lines of content maximum per response

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Splitting vs. Trimming Policy

**MANDATORY APPROACH**: When content exceeds 150 lines, **ALWAYS SPLIT** into multiple parts. **NEVER TRIM** or condense content.

**Why Splitting is Required:**
- ✅ **Preserves ALL educational content** - No loss of examples, explanations, or concepts
- ✅ **Maintains learning value** - Each part remains complete and actionable
- ✅ **Better learning experience** - Learners get comprehensive coverage across parts
- ✅ **Follows 25-minute principle** - Each part fits within focused learning session

**Why Trimming is Prohibited:**
- ❌ **Loses educational content** - Examples, explanations, or concepts may be removed
- ❌ **Reduces learning value** - Condensed content may miss important details
- ❌ **Violates zero-copy policy** - If source had comprehensive content, we should preserve it
- ❌ **Poor learning experience** - Learners miss important information

**Splitting Process:**
1. **Identify logical breakpoints** - Split at natural topic boundaries (e.g., "Foundation" → "Implementation" → "Advanced")
2. **Preserve all content** - Move content to appropriate part, don't delete
3. **Maintain completeness** - Each part should be self-contained and complete
4. **Use proper naming** - Follow naming convention: `Part1-A.md`, `Part1-B.md`, etc.
5. **Update references** - Update all file references after splitting

**Example**: If a file has 300 lines covering "Computer Vision Basics" and "Advanced Computer Vision", split into:
- `01_Computer-Vision-Basics-Part1-A.md` (Basics - 150 lines)
- `01_Computer-Vision-Basics-Part1-B.md` (Advanced - 150 lines)

**NOT**: Condense to 150 lines by removing examples or explanations.

## 📋 Required Content Structure

### 5 Required Study Content Metadata Fields

Every educational content file MUST include:

```yaml
---
learning_level: "Beginner" | "Intermediate" | "Advanced"
prerequisites: ["required knowledge", "prior concepts"]
estimated_time: "25 minutes"  # Standard, adjust if needed
learning_objectives:
  - "Specific, measurable outcome 1"
  - "Specific, measurable outcome 2"
related_topics:
  prerequisites: ["../prerequisite-content/"]
  builds_upon: ["../foundational-content/"]
  enables: ["../advanced-content/"]
  cross_refs: ["../related-domains/"]
---
```

### Numbering Convention

✅ **ALWAYS** use zero-padded numeric prefixes starting at `01_`  
❌ **NEVER** use `00_` prefixes - **NO EXCEPTIONS**  
✅ Keep numbering stable; add new numbers rather than renumbering widely  
✅ Use hyphens for multi-word names: `01_Software-Design-Principles/`

**CRITICAL**: This rule applies to **ALL files** in the repository:
- ✅ Study content files (`docs/sessions/`, `src/`)
- ✅ Documentation files (`docs/`)
- ✅ Any numbered files anywhere in the repository
- ❌ **NO EXCEPTIONS** - `00_` is NEVER allowed, even for meta/documentation files

**Why This Rule Exists**:
- Maintains consistent numbering across the repository
- Prevents confusion about file ordering
- Ensures predictable file organization
- `01_` clearly indicates the first item, `00_` is ambiguous

### Learning Order Requirements (CRITICAL)

**CRITICAL**: File numbering MUST reflect logical learning dependencies, not arbitrary ordering.

**AI-102 Exam Domain Organization** (organized by exam objectives):

1. **01**: Plan and manage an Azure AI solution - Foundation and planning
2. **02**: Implement generative AI solutions - Azure OpenAI integration
3. **03**: Implement an agentic solution - AI agents and workflows
4. **04**: Implement computer vision solutions - Image and video processing
5. **05**: Implement natural language processing solutions - Text analytics and language understanding
6. **06**: Implement knowledge mining and information extraction solutions - Cognitive Search and data extraction

**Why This Order Matters**:

- Planning and management (01) should come first as it provides the foundation
- Generative AI (02) and Agentic solutions (03) build on planning concepts
- Computer Vision (04) and NLP (05) are specialized domains that can be studied independently
- Knowledge Mining (06) often integrates with other domains, so it comes last

**When Creating New Content**:

- ✅ Verify prerequisites are numbered BEFORE the new content
- ✅ Check that "enables" relationships point to content numbered AFTER
- ✅ Ensure learning dependencies match file numbering order
- ❌ NEVER place content that depends on later-numbered files

### File Naming Convention for Split Files

**CRITICAL**: When files are split into multiple parts, use simplified letter suffixes.

**Pattern**:

- `Topic-Part1-Part1.md` → `Topic-Part1-A.md`
- `Topic-Part1-Part2.md` → `Topic-Part1-B.md`
- `Topic-Part2-Part1.md` → `Topic-Part2-A.md`
- `Topic-Part2-Part2.md` → `Topic-Part2-B.md`
- `Topic-Part1-Part2-Part1.md` → `Topic-Part1-B-A.md`
- `Topic-Part1-Part2-Part2.md` → `Topic-Part1-B-B.md`

**Rules**:
1. ✅ **Keep first Part number** - First `Part1`, `Part2`, etc. stays as-is
2. ✅ **Convert subsequent Part numbers to letters** - `Part1` → `A`, `Part2` → `B`, etc.
3. ✅ **Use uppercase letters** - A, B, C, D, etc. (not a, b, c)
4. ✅ **Maintain order** - Letters reflect the original Part number sequence

**Examples**:
- ✅ `01_Plan-Manage-AI-Solution-Part1-A.md` (was `Part1-Part1`)
- ✅ `01_Plan-Manage-AI-Solution-Part1-B.md` (was `Part1-Part2`)
- ✅ `02_Generative-AI-Part2-A.md` (was `Part2-Part1`)
- ✅ `04_Computer-Vision-Part1-B-A.md` (was `Part1-Part2-Part1`)

**Benefits**:
- Cleaner, more readable file names
- Easier to understand part relationships
- Consistent naming pattern

---

## 🎓 Educational Excellence Standards

All content must demonstrate:

- ✅ **Clear objectives and outcomes**: Specific, measurable learning goals
- ✅ **Progressive scaffolding**: Foundations → Practice → Pitfalls → Next Steps
- ✅ **Original examples, datasets, and exercises**: Never reuse source examples
- ✅ **Mermaid-first visuals**: Primary Mermaid diagrams with ASCII fallback for compatibility
- ✅ **Cross-references across exam domains**: Computer Vision, NLP, Knowledge Mining, Generative AI, Agentic Solutions, Responsible AI

---

## ✅ Quality Gate Questions (Before Publishing)

**Self-check before finalizing any educational content**:

1. ✅ Is this explanation clearer than the source material?
2. ✅ Does this fit naturally in the learning progression?
3. ✅ Would a learner understand this without the original source?
4. ✅ Are the examples relevant and practical?
5. ✅ Does this content add educational value beyond the reference?
6. ✅ Is this content within 150 lines for effective delivery?

---

## 📁 Content Placement Policy

✅ `docs/sessions/` is for study notes organized by AI-102 exam domains  
✅ `src/` is for code samples and hands-on labs organized by Azure AI services  
❌ Never mix planning materials, workflow docs, or meta content  
✅ Group logically by AI-102 exam domains, not source structure  
✅ Place content in correct domain folder (computer-vision/natural-language/knowledge-mining/generative-ai/agentic-solutions/responsible-ai)

### 🚨 CRITICAL: Code Examples Policy

**This repository is for AI-102 certification preparation. Code examples should be practical and focused on Azure AI services.**

**Code Examples in Educational Content:**

- ✅ **Practical Examples**: Code examples should demonstrate Azure AI service usage
- ✅ **Teaching-Focused**: Code should demonstrate Azure AI concepts and best practices
- ✅ **Runnable Code**: Include complete, runnable examples that can be tested with Azure AI services
- ✅ **Well-Documented**: Include setup instructions, prerequisites, and explanations
- ✅ **Exam-Relevant**: Focus on code that aligns with AI-102 exam objectives

**When Creating Code Examples:**

1. **Keep it focused**: Show code that demonstrates Azure AI service usage for the specific concept
2. **Add comments**: Explain what the code demonstrates and how it relates to AI-102 exam objectives
3. **Make it runnable**: Include complete, runnable examples that can be tested with Azure AI services
4. **Include setup**: Provide setup instructions, prerequisites, and configuration details
5. **Focus on learning**: Code should teach Azure AI concepts and best practices relevant to the exam

**Example Structure:**

```markdown
## Azure Computer Vision Example

Here's a minimal example demonstrating Azure Computer Vision API usage:

```python
# Minimal illustrative example
from azure.cognitiveservices.vision.computervision import ComputerVisionClient
from azure.cognitiveservices.vision.computervision.models import VisualFeatureTypes

# Initialize client
client = ComputerVisionClient(endpoint, CognitiveServicesCredentials(key))

# Analyze image
result = client.analyze_image(image_url, visual_features=[VisualFeatureTypes.objects])
```

> **Full Implementation**: See complete Azure AI service implementation examples in the `src/` directory
```

### Source Materials Staging Area

**Location**: `source-materials/` (at repository root, git-ignored)

**Purpose**: **Staging folder for migration** - Temporary staging area where source content is placed before review and transformation into AI-102 study materials.

**Critical Workflow**:

1. **Place materials**: User places source materials (transcripts, notes, documents) in `source-materials/` folder
2. **Review and migrate**: AI assistant reviews content, identifies unique topics, and migrates/transforms following Educational Content Rules
3. **Verify migration**: Confirm all unique content has been migrated to `docs/sessions/` or `src/`
4. **Keep source files**: After successful migration, keep source files in `source-materials/` folder - user will delete manually

**Important Notes**:

- ⚠️ **Files in `source-materials/` are NOT required to be compliant** - this is a staging area for raw source content
- ❌ **NEVER MODIFY files in `source-materials/`** - AI assistants must ONLY READ these files for migration purposes, never edit, format, or change them
- ✅ **Review rules apply DURING transformation** - ensure transformation process follows all Educational Content Rules
- ✅ **When user requests migration**: Review ALL files in `source-materials/`, identify unique content, and migrate to appropriate location
- ✅ Files here will be transformed into study materials organized by AI-102 exam domains
- ✅ After transformation, create content in `docs/sessions/` or `src/` as appropriate
- ✅ **After successful migration**: Keep source files in `source-materials/` folder - user will delete manually
- ❌ **Never commit `source-materials/` content** - it's git-ignored for a reason
- ✅ **Keep `source-materials/` folder** - it's a permanent staging area for future migrations

**Transformation Workflow** (Using CoT, ReAct, and Reasoning):

**🚨 CRITICAL**: This workflow uses **THE EXACT SAME 7-CATEGORY REVIEW CHECKLIST** as the Comprehensive Content Review Process. Every file created during migration MUST pass all review checks before being considered complete.

1. **OBSERVE**: Place source materials (transcripts, notes, etc.) in `source-materials/` (at repository root)
   - Scan and catalog source content
   - Identify key concepts and learning objectives
   - Understand source structure and dependencies

2. **ANALYZE**: Apply review rules DURING transformation using CoT/ReAct methodology:
   - **Reason through transformation**: Break down source content into logical learning segments
   - **Apply 7-category review checklist while transforming**:
     - Verify YAML frontmatter structure as you create it
     - Ensure content is transformative (not copied) during transformation
     - **Check line count as you build content (≤ 150 lines) - SPLIT if exceeds, NEVER TRIM**
     - Validate file naming conventions during creation
     - Verify file references as you add them
     - Ensure zero-copy policy compliance during transformation
     - Confirm learning progression logic as you structure content
     - **Preserve ALL educational content through splitting, not condensing**
   - **Use Chain-of-Thought**: Think through each transformation step explicitly
   - **Apply Reasoning**: Make logical decisions about content structure, examples, and explanations

3. **REASON**: Create new study content in appropriate `docs/sessions/` or `src/` folders
   - Apply logical reasoning to determine correct placement
   - Ensure learning dependencies are properly structured
   - Verify content flow and progression

4. **VERIFY**: Review final content using comprehensive review checklist before committing
   - Cross-check all requirements
   - Validate compliance with all rules
   - Confirm zero-copy policy adherence
   - **Create migration verification report** in `docs/review-reports/` with date-based naming (e.g., `24Nov2025.md`)

5. **ACT**: After successful migration and verification:
   - Keep source files in `source-materials/` folder - user will delete manually
   - Save migration verification report to `docs/review-reports/` with date-based filename

**Compliance Requirements**:
- ❌ `source-materials/` files: **NO compliance required** (staging area - raw source content)
- ✅ **Transformation process**: **MUST follow review rules** (apply checklist during transformation)
- ✅ `docs/sessions/` files: Should follow study material best practices
- ✅ `src/` files: Should follow code example best practices and include proper documentation

**Review During Migration** (Using CoT, ReAct, and Reasoning):

- **OBSERVE**: Systematically analyze source content before transformation
- **ANALYZE**: Apply the 7-category Individual File Review Checklist **while transforming** content
  - Use Chain-of-Thought to break down transformation into logical steps
  - Apply ReAct methodology: Observe → Analyze → Reason → Verify → Act
  - Use systematic reasoning to make transformation decisions
- **REASON**: Make logical decisions about:
  - Content structure and organization
  - Example selection and creation
  - Learning progression and dependencies
  - File naming and references
- **VERIFY**: Don't wait until after migration - catch issues during the transformation process
  - Verify compliance at each step: YAML structure, line count, naming, references, zero-copy policy
  - Cross-check findings as you transform
- **ACT**: Final review after migration confirms all requirements are met

**🚨 CRITICAL RULE ALIGNMENT**: Migration and Review use **THE EXACT SAME RULES AND CHECKLIST**. The 7-category Individual File Review Checklist (YAML Frontmatter, Content Structure, File Naming, File References, Content Quality, Zero-Copy Policy, Learning Progression) MUST be applied during migration/transformation, not just during review. The same CoT, ReAct, and Reasoning methodology used for reviews MUST be applied during migration/transformation.

### Study Content Organization Policy

**Important**: Content is organized by AI-102 exam domains as you study.

**Policy**:
- ✅ Create folders in `docs/sessions/` organized by exam domain when you have content ready
- ✅ Create folders in `src/` organized by Azure AI service when you have code examples ready
- ✅ Empty folders are acceptable - they indicate planned content areas
- ❌ Do not create extensive empty folder hierarchies in advance
- ✅ Add content progressively following Educational Content Rules
- ✅ Create folder structure incrementally as you study each exam domain

**Rationale**: This prevents creating empty structures that may never be populated, while allowing for organized study content as you progress through AI-102 exam preparation.

## 🔗 File Reference Requirements (CRITICAL)

### Mandatory Practices

**CRITICAL**: All file references MUST point to existing files or be clearly marked as planned content.

### When Creating File References

1. ✅ **Verify file exists** before adding reference
2. ✅ **Use exact file names** - match actual file names exactly (including all part suffixes)
3. ✅ **Test references** - run `.\tools\psscripts\Validate-FileReferences.ps1` after adding references
4. ✅ **Update after splitting** - when splitting files, update ALL references to that file immediately

### When Splitting Files

**CRITICAL WORKFLOW**:

1. Create new part files
2. **IMMEDIATELY** run: `.\tools\psscripts\Validate-FileReferences.ps1` to find all references
3. Update ALL references to point to correct part files
4. Run validation again to verify
5. Test navigation manually

### Reference Patterns

- **Prerequisites/Builds Upon**: Use first part (`-Part1-Part1.md`) or specific part if needed
- **Enables**: Can reference any part, typically next part in sequence
- **Planned Content**: References to files that don't exist yet are acceptable IF clearly marked as planned

### Validation Checklist

Before committing:
- [ ] Run `.\tools\psscripts\Validate-FileReferences.ps1`
- [ ] All references point to existing files (or are clearly planned)
- [ ] Navigation links work in markdown preview
- [ ] No broken references remain

---

## 🎯 Study Content Guidelines

**CRITICAL**: All study content should be organized by AI-102 exam domains and focus on practical Azure AI service implementation.

### Generic Content Policy

❌ **NEVER** include company-specific names (Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Meta, etc.)  
❌ **NEVER** reference company-specific frameworks by name (e.g., "Amazon Leadership Principles")  
❌ **NEVER** create company-specific interview scripts or answers  
✅ **ALWAYS** use generic descriptions (e.g., "Leadership Principles", "Clarity–Energy–Success model")  
✅ **ALWAYS** frame content for broad applicability across organizations  
✅ **ALWAYS** focus on universal principles and practices  

**Rationale**: Interview prep content should be applicable to any organization, not tied to specific companies. This makes the content more valuable and reusable.

**Examples of Generic Framing**:
- ❌ "Amazon Leadership Principles" → ✅ "Leadership Principles (ownership, customer focus, bias for action)"
- ❌ "Microsoft's Clarity–Energy–Success model" → ✅ "Clarity–Energy–Success model (bringing clarity, energizing teams, driving success)"
- ❌ "For Amazon, AWS roles" → ✅ "For high-pressure TPM roles, customer-obsessed organizations"
- ❌ "For Google, Meta, Stripe, Uber" → ✅ "For deep-tech companies, innovation-focused organizations"

**When Creating Study Content**:
1. Focus on AI-102 exam objectives and Azure AI services
2. Include practical examples and hands-on labs
3. Reference official Microsoft documentation
4. Make content applicable to exam preparation and real-world scenarios

---

## 🔍 Comprehensive Content Review Process

**MANDATORY**: All content in `docs/sessions/` and `src/` folders should follow best practices for study materials and code examples.

**🚨 CRITICAL RULE ALIGNMENT**: Migration and Review use **THE EXACT SAME RULES AND CHECKLIST**. The 7-category Individual File Review Checklist MUST be applied during migration/transformation, not just during review. This ensures all content is compliant from the moment it's created.

### Review Request Protocol

**When a review is REQUESTED**:

- ✅ **MANDATORY**: Review EACH AND EVERY file individually - no file should be skipped
- ✅ **MANDATORY**: Open and examine every file in the specified scope
- ✅ **MANDATORY**: Apply the 7-category review checklist to every single file
- ❌ **NEVER**: Skip files, assume compliance, or review only a sample
- ❌ **NEVER**: Review only files that "look problematic" - review ALL files

**Scope of Review**:
- If reviewing `docs/sessions/` folder: Review ALL files in `docs/sessions/`
- If reviewing `src/` folder: Review ALL code samples in `src/`
- If reviewing a specific subfolder: Review ALL files in that subfolder
- If reviewing specific files: Review each requested file individually

### Review Methodology

**Use CoT, ReAct, and Reasoning for every review**:

1. **OBSERVE**: Systematically scan and catalog all files
   - List every file in the review scope
   - No file should be excluded or skipped
2. **ANALYZE**: Review each file individually with deep analysis
   - Open and examine every file
   - Apply review checklist to each file
3. **REASON**: Apply logical reasoning to identify issues and patterns
4. **VERIFY**: Cross-check findings and validate compliance
5. **ACT**: Document findings and update content as needed

### Individual File Review Checklist

**Review EACH AND EVERY file individually** - no file should be skipped:

#### 1. YAML Frontmatter Review
- [ ] YAML frontmatter present (starts with `---`)
- [ ] All 5 required metadata fields present:

- [ ] `enables:` relationships point to content numbered after
- [ ] Learning order is logical and sequential

### Deep Dive Review Process

**When performing comprehensive review**:

1. **Systematic File Scanning**
   ```powershell
   # Get all files to review
   Get-ChildItem "docs\sessions" -Recurse -Filter "*.md" | 
       Where-Object { $_.Name -ne "README.md" }
   ```

2. **Individual File Analysis**
   - Open each file
   - Check YAML frontmatter structure
   - Verify all metadata fields
   - Count lines (must be ≤ 150)
   - Check file naming conventions
   - Validate all file references
   - Review content quality indicators

3. **Reference Validation**
   ```powershell
   # Run reference validation
   .\tools\psscripts\Validate-FileReferences.ps1
   ```

4. **Content Quality Analysis**
   - Check for code examples
   - Check for diagrams (Mermaid/ASCII)
   - Check for headings
   - Check for suspicious patterns
   - Verify zero-copy compliance

5. **Documentation**
   - Document all findings
   - Create issue list with file paths
   - Prioritize issues (critical vs. warnings)
   - Track fixes and verification

### Review Tools

**Use these tools for comprehensive review**:

- `.\tools\psscripts\Comprehensive-ReferenceReview.ps1` - Deep dive review with CoT/ReAct methodology
- `.\tools\psscripts\Validate-FileReferences.ps1` - File reference validation
- `.\tools\psscripts\Review-EducationalContent.ps1` - General compliance review

### Review Frequency

- **Before committing**: Review all modified files
- **After splitting files**: Review all affected files and references
- **Periodic audits**: Comprehensive review of study materials in `docs/sessions/` folder
- **After major changes**: Full review of affected sections

### Review Documentation

**Always document review findings**:

- Create review reports with findings
- List all issues found (with file paths)
- Track compliance statistics
- Document fixes applied
- Verify fixes after remediation
